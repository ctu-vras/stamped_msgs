# stamped_msgs

Stamped versions of std_msgs.

Use of these message types is discouraged by Open Robotics - everybody should create semantically meaningful message types instead. But these stamped messages can be used for quick prototyping.

Because it is actually not suggested to use the messages provided by this package, there will never be any binary ROS release of this package.
